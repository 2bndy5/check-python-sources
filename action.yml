  extensions:

      The file extensions to run the action against.
      This comma-separated string defaults to 'py,pyi'.
    required: false
    default: "py,pyi"
  repo-root:
    description: >
      The relative path to the repository root directory. The default value '.' is relative to the runner's GITHUB_WORKSPACE environment variable.
    required: false
    default: '.'
  verbosity:
    descruption: A hidden option to control the action's log verbosity. This is the `logging` level (degaults to DEBUG)
    required: false
    default: '10'
  files-changed-only:
    description: Set this option to 'true' to only analyse changes in the event's diff. Defaults to 'false'.
    required: false
    default: false
  ignore:
    description: >
      Set this option with string of path(s) to ignore.

      - In the case of multiple paths, you can use a pipe character ('|')
        to separate the multiple paths. Multiple lines are forbidden as input to this option.
      - This can also have files, but the file's relative path has to be specified
        as well.
      - There is no need to use './' for each entry; a blank string ('') represents
        the repo-root path (specified by the `repo-root` input option).
      - Path(s) containing a space should be inside single quotes.
      - Submodules are automatically ignored.
      - Prefix a path with a bang (`!`) to make it explicitly not ignored - order of
        multiple paths does take precedence. The `!` prefix can be applied to
        submodules if desired.
      - Glob patterns are not supported here. All asterick characters ('*') are literal.
    required: false
    default: ".github"
